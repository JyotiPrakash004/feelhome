# Interiorismo - AI-Powered Interior Design App by FeelHome (Team: Techies)

*Interiorismo* is a mobile application that revolutionizes interior design by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence. It provides users with an intuitive and engaging way to design their dream homes, regardless of their design expertise.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a user-friendly app that simplifies the often complex process of interior design. Users can input their room details, explore AI-generated design inspirations through a Tinder-like swiping interface, and receive personalized design recommendations. The app also features product recommendations, allowing users to easily shop for the furniture and decor they see in their designs.

## Key Features

* *Room Details Input:* Users can provide specific details about their space, such as room type, size, and amenities.
* *AI-Generated Design Inspiration:* The app generates a series of design images tailored to the user's input.
* *Swiping Interface:* Users can swipe left or right to indicate their preferences, providing feedback to the AI.
* *Personalized Design Recommendations:* Based on user preferences, the AI creates a final, customized interior design.
* *Product Recommendations:* The app identifies and suggests furniture and decor items featured in the designs, linking to shopping pages.
* *User Profiles:* Users can save their favorite designs and preferences.
* *Responsive and Intuitive UI:* Designed for a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Note
The front end of the app is under development, with a completed no-code UI on Figma, and a backend with python and Gemini Flash 1.5 for image generation (Imagen). Further automation and database retrieval can be created over a longer time frame and we will implement it shortly.
